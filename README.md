This script is designed so that players who do not need to be sent to state prison can be sent to police station cells based on their ID and sentence time.

Police can use command `/localjail` and select the nearby player to jail, as well as which cell to use.

## INSTALATION
- Drop the resource into your server's resources folder
- Configure cell locations and label
- Add to server.cfg and restart server
